    - SUPABASE_URL → Found under "Project URL"
    - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY → Found under "anon public" in "Project API Keys"
- 🔗 [Go to Supabase Storage → Buckets](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/settings/api-keys)
    - BUCKET_NAME → Choose or create a bucket (e.g., `files`, `temp-files`)
    - BUCKET_POLICIES → Select `New policy > For full customization > Select All (Allowed operation section)`

Make sure your bucket's public access is enabled, or adjust RLS policies accordingly.
